    "    This question is of interest because public safety is always a critical matter that should be monitored on a regular basis. Without strict monitoring of the improvement of DUI arrest rates over time, we cannot take action to improve the experience of San Diego citizens or tourists taking part in our city's night life. Background information that led to our hypothesis that arrest rates are improving included reports of arrest rates from prior years in the entire state (a DMV report that tracked changes in the arrest rate and alcohol related fatalities at https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/77b8b0e3-c20b-42b0-8670-451d9c9262cd/S5-250.pdf?MOD=AJPERES) and articles about police officers setting up DUI checkpoints more often during holidays and other higher-risk times of year. \n",

We would like to introduce San Diego specific data to see if our city's trends are matching state trends, and introduce more current data (up to 2016) to see if city DUI arrest rates are keeping a steady trend, decreasing, or increasing. We have also seen reports of DUI checkpoint locations at https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/77b8b0e3-c20b-42b0-8670-451d9c9262cd/S5-250.pdf?MOD=AJPERES, and we would like to see if the prevalence of these checkpoints has contributed at all to decreasing rates. Both our sources are government operated, therefore we consider them reputable. We would like to see if PD and social awareness are bringing arrests and misdemeanors down, or if there is still a need for further action.\n",

The next two relationships mean a negative correlation between our two variables. If arrests increase and crashes decrease, that means the police are doing a better job at catching drunk drivers. If arrests decrease and crashes increase that the police are doing a worse job at catching drunk drivers or drunk drivers. Obviously these cannot be blanket statements of causation but they do express correlation. Our ratios for each area will give us insight into these relationships.\n",

    "One main pitfall in our research will be able to account those who drive under the influence who are neither caught nor in a crash because there is no way of recording their existence wihtout privacy and ethical issues. For our purposes, we are measuring the total amount of drunk drivers on the road are those who are either caught or end up in a crash.\n",

    "One bias we have in our study is that we assume drunk drivers are coming from places with alcohol permits. Seeing that most bars are in the Pacific Beach area, we assume that most drunk drivers are coming from that area to measure how long drunk drivers are on the road before cops catch them. We are trying to minimize this bias by using locations of alcohol permits to show that PB is a alcohol hotspot. However, it is quite possible that drunk drivers can be driving from another locations. Drivers may also be simply buying from a place that sells alcohol and not necessarily consuming in that area.\n",

As of now, we are only looking at data in the San Diego area which may cut us off from any state or national data sets. If we find a lack of data for just San Diego, we will explore these larger data sets."
